Message passing techniques of choice are:
- REST 
- gRPC
- Message Queues using Kafka

In order to facilitate integration with the various HTTP routes, the frontend client makes use of REST message
passing techniique. REST offers a comparatively high throughput in API performance and is the most 
straightforward method of message transfer that doesn't add needless complexity to our system so as to provide
ease for integration to the required APIs.
For the purpose of consuming a sizable amount of location data from the mobile devices, gRPC was selected as 
the message passing protocol. The decision was made to take advantage of gRPC's enhanced performance, 
which includes less connection overhead and overall payload size.  By doing this, we can make sure that our
system is capable of handling the massive amount of location data that will be provided from various 
mobile devices.
The location consumer service manages the ingested location data using a message queue (Kafka). 
This will enable decoupling of our systems as well as enhanced performance and reliability 
(without losing imported data). Due to the advantages of the two message passing techniques, 
using the message queue along with gRPC for the ingestion of location data from the mobile device offers a 
variety of benefits.
