The Location Consumer Service which contains the logic for receiving the location events of users to the saved
to the DB uses the grpc message passing model. 
The choice of grpc is due to the following reasons:
1. Since most of the location data will be coming from mobile devices, gRPC can create effective backend server
   and mobile communication because it allows quick, low-latency communication making it a great choice for
   the location consumer service.
2. Due to the large number of data that will be received for user locations, gRPC is a highly performant message passing
   technique which would be useful in consuming this large data volume.

Kafka is used as the message queue for receiving the location events from the location service. The choice of
of kafka for the message queue is due the fact that kafka is a distributed message queue that can handle
real-time processing of data as is the case here for multiple location events. Kafka also provides an excellent
choice for scaling the system to handle high volume of user location data.

The Person Service and Connection Service both utilize REST for their message passing technique. REST provides
an excellent choice for these services because there is a direct communication between these services and the
front end client as such enabling seamless integration to these services.
